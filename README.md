# THE CARD GAME 


## Project structure

The project is structured in 3 main parts:
* Cards (where the data is loaded)
* Details
* Controls

In App.vue all files are combined together to show up in the index.html in a running porject.

## Used language

The project is basically build with Vue.js and Bootstrap 4. In addition HTML, CSS, Javascript and some additional Javascript frameworks like NodeJS and the Javascript library jQuery for using Bootstrap 4 and Vue.js were used. 

## Run project

To run the productiv part you have to open the terminal and enter:
```
$npm install -g serve
```

to ensure that serve is installed and then: 
```
$serve -s dist
```
The reason is that the productiv code is in the dist folder.
